responder vs non-responder at D14 (when sensitivity peaks)
Responder at day 0 vs day 14



what to do differently for processed vs technical replicate


look at marie pre-processing/cleanup script


how to treat sprate fractions and separate studies
-might be batch effect - need to check even if its negligible
- check difference between replicates - should be small variability




toggle for tehcnical vs processed replicate


ask Pauline for coerrect dataset - is data normalised, etc, what steps were used in processing



accession numbers



Expectation:
Responders have a change in protein on day 14 from day 0
Responders vs non-responders have a difference in protein level on day 14
In responders the protein level increased gradually from day 14 to day 0

In responders protein returned closer to baseline by day X - do we have this data???

The protein matches with one found by Marie

Validate the hypersensitivity peaked on day 14
Look at raw sensitivity scores and correlations with proteins

differentiation between sensitivity to pain and actual pain


Data:
- Group (responder/non-responder)
- Protein levels at day 0
- Protein elvels at day 14



Techniques:
- linear regression
- logistic regression
- spearman's or pearson's
- wilcoxon signed rank test
- welches T-test
- some for of clustering
- PCA



Questions:
- can I have the longitudinal data pls?
- is the data raw or normalised?
- has any other data preprocessing been done (e.g. log2 transformation)?
- what are the reasons for missing values? MNAR? Technical issues?
- what processing did you do? Particularly in terms of how you produced the replicates and what batches you processed in
- do you have pain scores for the longitudinal/chronic data

- how did you differentiate responders and non-responders


- responder if over 20% threshold in sensitivity
- can we get the raw change in sensitivity? 
	- could see if there's a correlation
	- also could validate the cut off threshold (e.g. with clustering)





sensitivity test - mechanical (also a thermal one)
what days were measurements taken
does it include the newton force applied/force when the participant reacted






Objectives
- find out about Pauline's data


- a way to include data from people who didn't come to every measurement session - mixed effect analysis? impute/extrapolate data
