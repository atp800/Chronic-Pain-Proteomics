attempts to isolate T cell clones 338 
from the brains of people with MS failed to show reactivity against myelin proteins. 
- but can be induved with myelin proteins

- phage display



pathological analyses of MS lesions suggest 392 
that early myelin abnormalities begin at the inner lamellae rather than the outer layers, which are more 393 
readily accessible to immune attack (145). Furthermore, recent studies highlight early pathological 394 
changes in normal-appearing white matter of people with MS, including increased myelin blistering, 395 
post-translational myelin modifications, and microglial responses against citrullinated MBP (146,147). 396 
These findings suggest that MS pathology may begin long before overt immune involvement, 397 
challenging the traditional autoimmune model.

S, and the results 42



EPstien barr triggers
-95% people have it
- ~100% MS patients have it

- molecular mimicry? Or causing damage in th einner lamerllae?




Focus should eb on seprateingt tpyes of MS and thei biological underpinnings

PAULINE:

looking at protein elvels over time - thousnads of rpotiens
-identify any that have clear pattern/correlation over time
-identify any that have clear pattern/correlation and against pain cores

- acute pain proetins might be different to chronic pain proteins

- look at ones correlated at all time points


- so far just look ed at difference from 0 at different time points fro each protein

Look at protein patterns in each individual person
-look at changes in prtein expression/levels over time in each person, identify which ones have patterns, THEN see how these compare across people
	- if disease is different in different people might see very clear pattersn but different in each person
